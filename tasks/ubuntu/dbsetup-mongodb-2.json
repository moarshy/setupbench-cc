The agent must import multiple JSON datasets into separate collections using mongoimport, while respecting document structure and enabling authentication. The data must be imported using the --jsonArray flag, and the agent must authenticate using a created user.",
  "problem_statement": "You are in a benchmark that evaluates your ability to interpret documentation, install dependencies, configure, and setup projects in a completely minimal environment.\n\nEnvironment Details\nYou are operating inside a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 environment with no tools or packages preinstalled \u2014 not even python3 or build-essential.\n\nKey constraints:\n\nYou must install all required dependencies globally using apt or other system-level installers.\nDo not create or use virtual environments (e.g., no venv, conda, or containerization).\nYour setup should be non-interactive and able to run in a headless CI environment.\nAssume you are starting from scratch \u2014 no assumptions about preinstalled tools.\nYou have root privileges in the environment, so there is no need to use sudo.\n\nTask:\nInstall MongoDB, enable authentication, and import all .json files from /testbed/import into the benchmark_db database. Ensure documents are imported as arrays using the correct flags. Create a user named benchmark_user with password benchmark_pass and authenticate using it for all operations, including import.\n\nAdditional Instructions:\n- At the end of the setup, you will be evaluated by running a single-line success command to confirm the task was successful.\n\n",
