These processes must coordinate through Redis and ensure periodic execution of tasks in the background. This task evaluates the agent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s skill with multi-process coordination, queuing systems, and scheduler setup in a containerized environment.",
  "problem_statement": "You are in a benchmark that evaluates your ability to interpret documentation, install dependencies, configure, and setup projects in a completely minimal environment.\n\nEnvironment Details\nYou are operating inside a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 environment with no tools or packages preinstalled \u2014 not even python3 or build-essential.\n\nKey constraints:\n\nYou must install all required dependencies globally using apt or other system-level installers.\nDo not create or use virtual environments (e.g., no venv, conda, or containerization).\nYour setup should be non-interactive and able to run in a headless CI environment.\nAssume you are starting from scratch \u2014 no assumptions about preinstalled tools.\nYou have root privileges in the environment, so there is no need to use sudo.\n\nTask:\nInstall Redis and Celery. Start a Redis server, then configure both a Celery worker and a Celery Beat scheduler as supervisord-managed background processes. The Celery app is located in /testbed/tasks.py. A periodic task should run and set the Redis key beat_check to 'alive'.\n\nAdditional Instructions:\n- At the end of the setup, you will be evaluated by running a single-line success command to confirm the task was successful.\n\n",
