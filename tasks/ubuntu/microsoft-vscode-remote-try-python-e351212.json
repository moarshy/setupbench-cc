  "problem_statement": "You are in a benchmark that evaluates your ability to interpret documentation, install dependencies, configure, and build real-world open-source projects in a completely minimal environment.\n\nEnvironment Details\nYou are operating inside a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 environment with no tools or packages preinstalled \u2014 not even python3 or build-essential.\n\nKey constraints:\n\nYou must install all required dependencies globally using apt or other system-level installers.\nDo not create or use virtual environments (e.g., no venv, conda, or containerization).\nYour setup should be non-interactive and able to run in a headless CI environment.\nAssume you are starting from scratch \u2014 no assumptions about preinstalled tools.\nYou have root privileges in the environment, so there is no need to use sudo.\n\nTask:\nYou must fully set up a GitHub repository. This may include installing dependencies, compiling and building the project, starting a server, etc. depending on the repository. Utilize the README and other documentation present in the repo the guide and inform your setup process.\n\nRepository URL:\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-python\n\n\nAdditional Instructions:\n- The repository has been cloned into the /testbed directory so that the root of the GitHub repository maps directly to /testbed. \n- At the end of the setup, you will be evaluated by running a single-line success command to confirm the build was successful.\n",
