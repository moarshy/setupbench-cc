  "description": "A robust background service task. The agent must configure autossh to persistently manage a reverse SSH tunnel and log its health status to a known file. The process must be managed by supervisord and automatically restart if it fails. This task simulates a resilient production tunnel with built-in monitoring.",
  "problem_statement": "You are in a benchmark that evaluates your ability to interpret documentation, install dependencies, configure, and setup projects in a completely minimal environment.\n\nEnvironment Details\nYou are operating inside a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 environment with no tools or packages preinstalled \u2014 not even python3 or build-essential.\n\nKey constraints:\n\nYou must install all required dependencies globally using apt or other system-level installers.\nDo not create or use virtual environments (e.g., no venv, conda, or containerization).\nYour setup should be non-interactive and able to run in a headless CI environment.\nAssume you are starting from scratch \u2014 no assumptions about preinstalled tools.\nYou have root privileges in the environment, so there is no need to use sudo.\n\nTask:\nInstall autossh and configure it as a persistent supervised process. The tunnel should connect remote port 9000 to localhost:22. Use AUTOSSH_LOGFILE to write logs to /var/log/autossh.log and AUTOSSH_POLL to enable health monitoring. The process must restart automatically if the tunnel fails.\n\nAdditional Instructions:\n- At the end of the setup, you will be evaluated by running a single-line success command to confirm the task was successful.\n\n",
