  "description": "A more advanced file monitoring task. The agent must configure a recursive file watcher that logs structured event data to disk and uses environment variables for configuration. The script must run under supervisord as a persistent process. This task evaluates advanced logging, process supervision, and dynamic script behavior.",
  "problem_statement": "You are in a benchmark that evaluates your ability to interpret documentation, install dependencies, configure, and setup projects in a completely minimal environment.\n\nEnvironment Details\nYou are operating inside a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 environment with no tools or packages preinstalled \u2014 not even python3 or build-essential.\n\nKey constraints:\n\nYou must install all required dependencies globally using apt or other system-level installers.\nDo not create or use virtual environments (e.g., no venv, conda, or containerization).\nYour setup should be non-interactive and able to run in a headless CI environment.\nAssume you are starting from scratch \u2014 no assumptions about preinstalled tools.\nYou have root privileges in the environment, so there is no need to use sudo.\n\nTask:\nInstall the watchdog Python package and configure the watcher.py script in /testbed to run as a supervised background process. It must recursively monitor a directory defined by the WATCH_PATH environment variable (default: /watched) and log create, delete, and modify events in JSON format to /var/log/watcher.json.log.\n\nAdditional Instructions:\n- At the end of the setup, you will be evaluated by running a single-line success command to confirm the task was successful.\n\n",
