  "description": "A complex Redis task simulating a real-world production deployment. The agent must configure Redis using a custom redis.conf, bind it to a non-default port, and run a Lua script via redis-cli --eval with multiple keys and arguments. Redis must run in the background with persistence and ACLs enabled. Port 6379 is blocked, a fake Redis process is running, and the configuration file contains a deliberate syntax error that must be resolved before Redis can start properly. Authentication is required using a benchmark_user with access to namespaced keys.",
  "problem_statement": "You are in a benchmark that evaluates your ability to interpret documentation, install dependencies, configure, and setup projects in a completely minimal environment.\n\nEnvironment Details\nYou are operating inside a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 environment with no tools or packages preinstalled \u2014 not even python3 or build-essential.\n\nKey constraints:\n\nYou must install all required dependencies globally using apt or other system-level installers.\nDo not create or use virtual environments (e.g., no venv, conda, or containerization).\nYour setup should be non-interactive and able to run in a headless CI environment.\nAssume you are starting from scratch \u2014 no assumptions about preinstalled tools.\nYou have root privileges in the environment, so there is no need to use sudo.\n\nTask:\nInstall Redis and start it using a custom redis.conf bound to port 6380. Run the Lua script in /testbed/scripts using redis-cli --eval with the correct KEYS and ARGV values. Configure ACLs for a benchmark_user with password benchmark_pass, and ensure Redis is running in daemonized mode with persistence enabled.\n\nAdditional Instructions:\n- At the end of the setup, you will be evaluated by running a single-line success command to confirm the task was successful.\n\n",
