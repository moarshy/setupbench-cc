The master should create job files every 10 seconds. Both processes should run in the background and restart if they fail.",
  "description": "A realistic multi-process coordination task. The agent must configure two supervised processes that interact through the filesystem: a job producer and a job consumer. The producer generates files, and the consumer processes them and logs the outcome. This task evaluates the agent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to coordinate background workflows using supervisord in isolation.",
  "problem_statement": "You are in a benchmark that evaluates your ability to interpret documentation, install dependencies, configure, and setup projects in a completely minimal environment.\n\nEnvironment Details\nYou are operating inside a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 environment with no tools or packages preinstalled \u2014 not even python3 or build-essential.\n\nKey constraints:\n\nYou must install all required dependencies globally using apt or other system-level installers.\nDo not create or use virtual environments (e.g., no venv, conda, or containerization).\nYour setup should be non-interactive and able to run in a headless CI environment.\nAssume you are starting from scratch \u2014 no assumptions about preinstalled tools.\nYou have root privileges in the environment, so there is no need to use sudo.\n\nTask:\nConfigure two supervisord-managed processes: one that creates job files in /queue, and another that processes those files into /processed and logs results to /var/log/processed.log. The master should create job files every 10 seconds. Both processes should run in the background and restart if they fail.\n\nAdditional Instructions:\n- At the end of the setup, you will be evaluated by running a single-line success command to confirm the task was successful.\n\n",
