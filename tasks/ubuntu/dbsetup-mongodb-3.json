  "notes": "Install MongoDB, configure it to run on port 27018, and start it as a replica set (rs0). Restore the BSON files using mongorestore. One of the BSON files may be corrupted and must be handled gracefully. Create a user named benchmark_user with password benchmark_pass and authenticate using it for all operations.",
  "description": "An advanced MongoDB setup challenge simulating production-like scenarios. The agent must initialize a replica set, reconfigure MongoDB to run on a non-default port, and restore a database from BSON files. One file is corrupted, requiring selective restoration. Authentication with a non-root user is required for success.",
  "problem_statement": "You are in a benchmark that evaluates your ability to interpret documentation, install dependencies, configure, and setup projects in a completely minimal environment.\n\nEnvironment Details\nYou are operating inside a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 environment with no tools or packages preinstalled \u2014 not even python3 or build-essential.\n\nKey constraints:\n\nYou must install all required dependencies globally using apt or other system-level installers.\nDo not create or use virtual environments (e.g., no venv, conda, or containerization).\nYour setup should be non-interactive and able to run in a headless CI environment.\nAssume you are starting from scratch \u2014 no assumptions about preinstalled tools.\nYou have root privileges in the environment, so there is no need to use sudo.\n\nTask:\nInstall MongoDB, configure it to run on port 27018, and start it as a replica set (rs0). Restore the BSON files using mongorestore. One of the BSON files may be corrupted and must be handled gracefully. Create a user named benchmark_user with password benchmark_pass and authenticate using it for all operations.\n\nAdditional Instructions:\n- At the end of the setup, you will be evaluated by running a single-line success command to confirm the task was successful.\n\n",
